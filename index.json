One such emerging fundamental design is Information Centric Networking (ICN). The Pending Interest Table (PIT) is one of the essential components of the ICN forwarding plane responsible for the stateful routing in ICN. Optimal size of the PIT is essential for the efficient performance of the network and the enhanced consumer experience. Therefore, the optimal sizing of the PIT under various network conditions is an important and challenging problem. To this end, this paper models the PIT of a router as a GI/M/c/N queue. The model has (i) a general arrival process to accommodate the diverse nature of traffic, (ii) a service time model which takes into account the caching at the content stores and the mobility of producers, and (iii) a sojourn time distribution which is used to characterize the content delivery time at the consumers. Using the GI/M/c/N queueing model, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the PIT size while subjecting the interest drop probability to an upper bound. The accuracy of our analytical model is demonstrated using simulations on different Internet Service Provider (ISP) topologies across a wide range of system parameters.","tags":null,"title":"Optimal Pending Interest Table Size for ICN with Mobile Producers ","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1593430200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593430200,"objectID":"2f133647c3b7fbb5708d2660f977af2d","permalink":"https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~vigneshs/talk/ncrypt20/","publishdate":"2020-06-29T11:30:00Z","relpermalink":"/~vigneshs/talk/ncrypt20/","section":"talk","summary":"While in-network caching is an essential feature of Information Centric Networks (ICN) for improved content dissemination and reducing the bandwidth consumption at the core of the network, it is prone to many privacy treats.

Recent market surveys show that failure of a data center is inevitable resulting in a huge financial loss. Fault-tolerance in distributed data centers is typically handled by provisioning spare capacity to mask failure at a site. We argue that the operating cost and data replication cost (for data availability) must be considered in spare capacity provisioning along with minimizing the number of servers. Since the operating cost and client demand vary across space and time, we propose cost-aware capacity provisioning to minimize the total cost of ownership (TCO) for fault-tolerant data centers. We formulate the problem of spare capacity provisioning in fault-tolerant distributed data centers using mixed integer linear programming (MILP), with an objective of minimizing the TCO. The model accounts for heterogeneous client demand, data replication strategies (single and multiple site), variation in electricity price and carbon tax, and delay constraints while computing the spare capacity. Solving the MILP using real-world data, we observed a saving in the TCO to the tune of 35% compared to a model that minimizes the total number of servers and 43% compared to the model that minimizes the average response time. We demonstrate that our model is beneficial when the cost of electricity, carbon tax, and bandwidth vary significantly across the locations, which seems to be the problem for most of the operators.","tags":null,"title":"Cost Efficient Design of Fault Tolerant Geo-Distributed Data Centers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rakesh Tripathi","Vignesh Sivaraman","Venkatesh Tamarapalli"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1479772800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1479772800,"objectID":"86f1b2d43e7c8e301f6dd512b6117f2c","permalink":"https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~vigneshs/publication/comletters16/","publishdate":"2016-11-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/~vigneshs/publication/comletters16/","section":"publication","summary":"Integrating renewable energy and ensuring high availability are two major requirements for geo-distributed data centers.
