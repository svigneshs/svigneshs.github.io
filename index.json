The transmission of sensitive data over the network induces the possibility of leakage of private and sensitive information about various entities and components in the grid. To address this issue, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving framework to enhance the privacy of smart-grids integrated with Software Defined Networks. The proposed framework uses two privacy metrics ( mutual information and differential privacy) and formulates a privacy preserving distributed optimization algorithm with the objective of minimizing the network cost. We view the distributed optimization algorithm as an $n$-player, non-cooperative game and provide distributed techniques to solve the optimization problem efficiently. We prove that our algorithm converges to the Nash equilibrium of the game while preserving the data privacy.

Recent market surveys show that failure of a data center is inevitable resulting in a huge financial loss. Fault-tolerance in distributed data centers is typically handled by provisioning spare capacity to mask failure at a site. We argue that the operating cost and data replication cost (for data availability) must be considered in spare capacity provisioning along with minimizing the number of servers. Since the operating cost and client demand vary across space and time, we propose cost-aware capacity provisioning to minimize the total cost of ownership (TCO) for fault-tolerant data centers. We formulate the problem of spare capacity provisioning in fault-tolerant distributed data centers using mixed integer linear programming (MILP), with an objective of minimizing the TCO. The model accounts for heterogeneous client demand, data replication strategies (single and multiple site), variation in electricity price and carbon tax, and delay constraints while computing the spare capacity. Solving the MILP using real-world data, we observed a saving in the TCO to the tune of 35% compared to a model that minimizes the total number of servers and 43% compared to the model that minimizes the average response time. We demonstrate that our model is beneficial when the cost of electricity, carbon tax, and bandwidth vary significantly across the locations, which seems to be the problem for most of the operators.","tags":null,"title":"Cost Efficient Design of Fault Tolerant Geo-Distributed Data Centers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rakesh Tripathi","Vignesh Sivaraman","Venkatesh Tamarapalli"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1479772800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1479772800,"objectID":"86f1b2d43e7c8e301f6dd512b6117f2c","permalink":"https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~vignesh/publication/comletters16/","publishdate":"2016-11-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/~vignesh/publication/comletters16/","section":"publication","summary":"Integrating renewable energy and ensuring high availability are two major requirements for geo-distributed data centers.
